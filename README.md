This tool is intended for learning words every day.
It allows to create a dictionary in a simple way and then to use it for quizzes.

Tool keeps track of which words are learned already and which are not yet.
Only the words that are not learned yet and words that should be repeated are included in a quiz (see [WordStates](https://github.com/yu-kopylov/cramtool/wiki/Word-States)).

Simple [Markup Language](https://github.com/yu-kopylov/cramtool/wiki/Markup-Language) allows to define translations, word forms and examples.

Each word can have a list of tags. They can be used to group words related to specific topics.

This tool requires .NET Framework 4.5 installed.
